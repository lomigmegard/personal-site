**Abstract:** Since the first computers, the barrier between the programmer and the user has always been impassable. The complexity of the programming environments and the prior knowledge required forbid any attempt to create own programs and limit the number of developers. With the increasing number of computers, tablets or smartphones, our society has the opportunity to give to each individual the tools to be more independent with respect to programmers.

This Master thesis presents the second version of Pong Designer, an environment for the end-user that helps developing games by demonstrating behaviors. The direct manipulation of objects state is used to show examples of behaviors. From these examples, the system is able to synthesize a rule generalizing the intended behavior beyond the original context. The user can rely on a 2D physics engine to create simulations and animations. Pong Designer is implemented in Scala and targets Android devices to make the best of the touch screen.

We describe an extension focused on the design of matrices as new objects available to the user. This thesis shows how, and through which choices, those matrices have been successfully integrated in Pong Designer as well as their utility during the development of new games. We present several case studies illustrating the power brought by matrices, including the sliding puzzle game and the balanced parentheses problem. Beside novelties like matrices and the use of a physics library, this report explains how existing features from the previous version of Pong Designer have been redesigned to improve robustness and extensibility.
