Currently working as a Software Engineer at [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com/), a startup based in Lausanne, I’m developing our new product which gives access to cryptocurrency investments to everyone. 
I am part of the backend team, making sure the scalability and security are central to our architecture and implementation. 
As a Senior Engineer, I thoughtfully guide my colleagues to tackle challenges and follow best practices through collaborative efforts. 

Previously, I was lucky to be part of very diverse teams, from an AdTech London startup, a european research project based in Geneva, to a large multinational IT company with a distributed team across the US and Europe. 
As a result of these varied roles, I gained insight into multiple programming paradigms as well as different working processes.

In 2014, I obtained my CS Master degree from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/), with a [specialization in language theory](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/specializations/) led by Prof. Odersky. 
Thereafter, I focused on functional programming using [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/) as my preferred language while gathering knowledge on its broad OSS ecosystem and contributing back to it.
