Previously, I had the chance to be part of very diverse teams, from an AdTech London startup, or a european research project based in Geneva, and to a large multinational IT company with a distributed team across the US and Europe. XXX more about the benefits of many different teams and companies XXX.

I have a Master in Computer Science from EPFL, with a specialization in Foundation of Softwares. XXX

I obtained my CS Master degree from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) in 2014.
I did a specialization in [Foundation of Software](http://ic.epfl.ch/specializations) with Prof. Odersky and my master thesis was performed in the field of Programming by Example under the direction of [Prof. Kuncak](https://lara.epfl.ch).

I then moved to London during one year where I worked as a Big Data Engineer for [Adbrain](https://www.adbrain.com/).
Currently established in Lausanne's area, and after an experience working for the [Human Brain Project](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/), I am starting a new role as a Scala Engineer at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/).

After being focused on the theory of CS and languages during my studies, I am now also interested in distributed systems and Big Data technologies.
I like the functional paradigm, using for example [Scala](https://scala-lang.org/), [Akka](http://akka.io/) or [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).
To manage my projects, sbt and git are my preferred choices.
